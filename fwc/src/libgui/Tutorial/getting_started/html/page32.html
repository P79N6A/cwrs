  Firewall Builder can also transfer generated script to the firewall
  and activate it there. It uses ssh to do this (putty on Windows). To
  use the installer, click on the "Install" toolbar button located
  above the firewall policy panel or in the main toolbar. Firewall
  Builder will compile the policy (if it is not compiled already) and
  then open a dialog where you can configure the parameters of the
  installer. Here you need to enter a password to authenticate to the
  firewall. Section Section 8.7 of the Users Guide has detailed
  instructions for setting up and using the installer.

  Firewall Builder 4.0 can cache password you entered so you don't
  have to enter it again and again if you need to reinstall firewall
  policy several times. The password is never stored on disk in any
  form, it is only cached in the memory of the running fwbuilder
  process and discarded when you stop the program. You will need to
  enter it again when you use the program again after that. However
  this feature really helps speed up policy update if you need to do
  it several times. To activate it you need to turn it on in the
  "Installer" tab of the global preferences dialog (menu Edit /
  Preferences) and then turn on checkbox "Remember passwords" in the
  installer dialog. Passwords are stored in a dictionary indexed by
  the firewall name and user name configured in the "Installer" tab of
  the firewall object dialog. This means you can have different
  passwords for different firewall objects.
