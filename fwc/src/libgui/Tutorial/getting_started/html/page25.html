  Firewall Builder 4.0 allows you to compile single policy or NAT rule
  and see generated firewall configuration right there in the GUI. To
  do this, select any object in the rule you want to process or
  highlight its leftmost element where rule number is shown, then
  click right mouse button to open context menu. Click "Compile rule"
  (keyboard shortcut is "X") to see the result in the panel at the
  bottom of the main window. The is a great way to experiment with
  rules and see what is being generated in response to your changes.
