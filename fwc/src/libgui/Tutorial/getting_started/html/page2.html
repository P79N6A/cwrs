  This page of the wizard shows template objects and their
  configuration. Standard template objects represent firewalls with
  two or three interfaces, a host with one interface, a web server or
  a Cisco router. We'll choose <b>"fw template 3"</b>, a firewall with
  three interfaces, for this example. Click <b>Next</b> to create a
  new firewall object using the chosen template.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the template firewall object comes completely configured,
  including addresses and netmasks for its interfaces and some basic
  policy and NAT rules. This configuration is intended as a starting
  point only. You should reconfigure addresses of interfaces to match
  those used on your network. We'll see how this is done later on.

  Clicking "Next" brings us to the next page of the wizard where we
  can change configuration of the interfaces of the template firewall.
