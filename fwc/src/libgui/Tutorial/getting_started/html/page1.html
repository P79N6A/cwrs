  The first page of the New Firewall wizard appears. In this page of
  the wizard we can enter the name for the new firewall object (here
  it is "guardian"), its platform ("iptables") and its host OS ("Linux
  2.4/2.6").
</p>

<p>
  The name of the new firewall object can be anything you
  want. However, if you want to use SNMP to populate the interface
  objects, or if you want to use DNS lookups to populate IP address
  objects, you must name the firewall object the same name as the
  actual firewall machine.
</p>

<p>
  There are three ways a new firewall can be created: you can use a
  pre-configured template firewall object, create it from scratch, or
  use SNMP to create a firewall object with interfaces but an empty
  policy. This turorial demonstrates the first method, using a
  template object.
</p>

<p>
  We are going to use one of the standard templates distributed with
  Firewall Builder, so we'll leave the standard template library path
  and name in the Template file input field. Click <b>Next</b> to move
  on to the next page of the tutorial.
