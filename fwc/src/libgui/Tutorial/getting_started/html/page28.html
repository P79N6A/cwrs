  Here are the pre-configured NAT rules:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Rule 0: Tells the firewall that no address translation should be
      done for packets traveling from network 192.168.2.0 to
      192.168.1.0 (because Translated Source, Translated Destination
      and Translated Service are left empty).
    </li>

    <li>
      Rule 1: Packets coming into the firewall from internal and DMZ
      networks are translated so that their source address will change
      to that of the outside interface on the firewall.
    </li>

    <li>
      Rule 2: Packets coming from the Internet to the interface
      "outside" will be translated and forwarded to the internal
      server on DMZ represented by the host object "server on dmz".
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
