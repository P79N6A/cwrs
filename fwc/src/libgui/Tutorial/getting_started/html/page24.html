  Let's take a look at the policy of the template firewall shown
  below.  These rules are intended to be an example, a starting point
  to help you create your own policy. Most likely you will want to
  modify the rules to suite your requirements. Explanations of the
  rules given here are brief because the goal of Getting Started is
  only to demonstrate how to use Firewall Builder.

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Rule 0: This is an anti-spoofing rule. It blocks incoming
      packets on the external interface that have source addresses
      that belong to the firewall or your internal or DMZ
      networks. The rule is associated with outside interface and has
      Direction set to "Inbound".
    </li>

    <li>
      Rule 1: This rule permits any packets on the loopback
      interface. This is necessary because many services on the
      firewall machine communicate back to the same machine via
      loopback.
    </li>

    <li>
      Rule 2: Permit ssh access from internal network to the firewall
      machine. Notice service object "ssh" in the column
      Service. (This object can be found in the Standard objects
      library in the Services/TCP folder.)
    </li>
  </ul>
