  Now we can compile the policy of the firewall "guardian" and
  generate the iptables script. To do so, use toolbar button located
  right above the panel that shows policy and NAT rules. This button
  compiles rules of the firewall that is opened at the
  moment. Compiler processes Policy, NAT and Routing rules even though
  the panel shows only one kind of rules at a time. Another button
  with the same picture is located in the main toolbar under the main
  menu bar compiles all firewall objects defined in the object
  tree. Of course there is no difference if you only have one firewall
  object.

  A new dialog appears that allows you to choose which firewalls you
  want to compile. The program keeps track of the changes and
  automatically selects firewalls that require recompile because some
  object they depend on has changed recently. Obviously this is only
  useful if you have several firewalls in the object tree. Since the
  checkbox next to the "guardian" firewall is already checked, click
  Next to proceed.
