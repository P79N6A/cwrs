  Let's take a little tour of the network and service objects that
  come standard with the program. You can use these pre-configured
  objects to build access Policy, NAT, and Routing rules for your
  firewall.

  Objects in the tree are organized in libraries. You can switch
  between libraries using the drop-down menu above the tree. Firewall
  Builder comes with a collection of address, service and time
  interval objects in the library called "Standard". Let's take a look
  at them.
