<h2>Linux 2.4/2.6 kernel settings</h2>

All of these parameters are controlled either with <b>sysctl</b>
command line tool or via <b>/proc</b> file system. See file
<b>ip-sysctl.txt</b> for description of these parameters, and more.

<h2>Tab Options</h2>
<p>

<h3>IPv4 Packet Forwarding</h3>
<p>
  Enable IPv4 forwarding between all interfaces

<h3>IPv6 Packet Forwarding</h3>
<p>
  Enable IPv6 forwarding between all interfaces

<h3>Kernel anti-spoofing protection</h3>
<p>
<i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter</i>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>1 - do source validation by reversed path, as specified in RFC1812
    Recommended option for single homed hosts and stub network
    routers. Could cause troubles for complicated (not loop free)
    networks running a slow unreliable protocol (sort of RIP),
    or using static routes.
  </li>
  <li>0 - No source validation. 
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Ignore broadcast pings</h3>
<p>
<i> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts</i> 
<p>
  If set to true, then the kernel will ignore ICMP echo requests sent to
  broadcast/multicast addresses.


<h3>Accept source route</h3>
<p>
  Accept packets with SRR option.


<h3>Accept ICMP redirects</h3>
<p>
  Accept ICMP Redirects.


<h3>Ignore bogus ICMP errors</h3>
<p>
  <i> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses</i>
<p>
  Some routers violate RFC 1122 by sending bogus responses to broadcast
  frames.  Such violations are normally logged via a kernel warning.  If
  this is set to TRUE, the kernel will not give such warnings, which
  will avoid log file clutter.

<h3>Allow dynamic addresses</h3>
<p>
  <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr</i>
<p>
  If set, enables support for dynamic addresses.


<h3>Log martians</h3>
<p>
  Log and drop "Martian" packets.  A "Martian" packet is one for which
  the host does not have a route back to the source IP address (it
  apparently dropped in from Mars).

<hr>
<h2>Tab TCP</h2>
<p>


  <h3>TCP FIN timeout</h3>
<p>
  <i> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout</i>
<p>
  Time to hold socket in state FIN-WAIT-2, if it was closed by our
  side. Peer can be broken and never close its side, or even died
  unexpectedly. Default value is 60sec.  Usual value used in 2.2 was 180
  seconds, you may restore it, but remember that if your machine is even
  underloaded WEB server, you risk to overflow memory with kilotons of
  dead sockets, FIN-WAIT-2 sockets are less dangerous than FIN-WAIT-1,
  because they eat maximum 1.5K of memory, but they tend to live longer.


  <h3>TCP keepalive time</h3>
<p>
  <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl</i>
<p>
  How often TCP sends out keepalive messages when keepalive is enabled.
  Default: 2hours.


  <h3>TCP window scaling</h3>
<p>
  <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling</i>
<p>
  Enable window scaling as defined in RFC1323.


  <h3>TCP sack</h3>
<p>
  <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_sack</i>
<p>
  Enable select acknowledgments (SACKS).



  <h3>TCP fack</h3>
<p>
  <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fack</i>
<p>
  Enable FACK congestion avoidance and fast retransmission.
  The value is not used, if tcp_sack is not enabled.


  <h3>TCP ECN</h3>
<p>
  <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn</i>
<p>
  Enable Explicit Congestion Notification in TCP.


  <h3>TCP SYN cookies</h3>
<p>
  <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies</i>
<p>
  Only valid when the kernel was compiled with CONFIG_SYNCOOKIES
  Send out syncookies when the syn backlog queue of a socket 
  overflows. This is to prevent against the common 'syn flood attack'
  Default: FALSE
<p>
  Note, that syncookies is fallback facility.
  It MUST NOT be used to help highly loaded servers to stand
  against legal connection rate. If you see synflood warnings
  in your logs, but investigation	shows that they occur
  because of overload with legal connections, you should tune
  another parameters until this warning disappear.
  See: tcp_max_syn_backlog, tcp_synack_retries, tcp_abort_on_overflow.
<p>
  syncookies seriously violate TCP protocol, do not allow
  to use TCP extensions, can result in serious degradation
  of some services (f.e. SMTP relaying), visible not by you,
  but your clients and relays, contacting you. While you see
  synflood warnings in logs not being really flooded, your server
  is seriously misconfigured.


  <h3>TCP timestamps</h3>
<p>
  <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_timestamps</i>
<p>
  Enable timestamps as defined in RFC1323.

<h2>Tab Path</h2>
<p>
  In this tab you can set path to the system command line tools used
  by generated iptables script. Use these if tools you expect to use
  are located in non-standard directories (such as "/usr/local/bin",
  "/use/local/sbin" etc.) Leave these blank if tools you expect to use
  are in standard system directories.
