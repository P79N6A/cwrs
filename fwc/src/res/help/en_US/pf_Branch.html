<h2>Rule Action "Branch"</h2>

<p>
This action is used to create a branch in the rule set. For PF this is
implemented using anchors. To use this action, create new Policy rule
set object, then drag and drop it into a well in the dialog of this
action. Note that you can use policy rule set object of another
firewall as well.
