</p>

<a name="gui"></a>
<h2>Changes in the GUI</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>fixed #1443 GUI crashes compiling file opened read-only. If a
      file that was added to RCS was opened read-only and then any
      firewall object in it compiled, the GUI crashed trying to update
      "last_compiled" timestamp.</p>

  </li>

<li>
    <p>fixed #1444 compile error on FreeBSD-Current
	Compiler issues error "/usr/include/utmp.h:2:2: error: #error
      &lt;utmp.h&gt; has been replaced by &lt;utmpx.h&gt;"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #1447: context menu item "Edit" associated with rule set
      object in the tree opens it in the rule set view and the editor
      panel. Menu item "Open" only opens it in the rule set view. This
      eliminates strange behavior where it would open in the rule set
      view on first click on "Edit" and then in the editor in the
      second click on "Edit". Double click used to work the same, the
      first double click opened in rule set view, the second in the
      editor. Now double click always opens in rule set view and the
      editor which is more consistent with the behavior for other
      object types.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1339 "Logging" icon appears looking the same as "Rule
      options" icon on Mac
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1460 "when "show icons in rules" is turned off, there is no
      way to tell when logging is turned on and non-default options are
      present in a rule".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1464, SourceForge bug 3004274: "Branch rule set object
      displays improperly".  Branch rule set attribute was not loaded
      properly into Branch action dialog for rules of PF firewalls.
    </p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1462 "if you do a bulk install, and then want to do a
      single install, bulk mode is selected"
    </p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1461 Need obvious button to add new rule to the empty
      rule set. Added button with a "+" icon right above the rule set
      view, this button adds new rule to the set.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #1457 "tooltips for rule options seem to be
      broken". Tooltip always includes the line telling of the rule is
      "stateful" or "stateless", the function almost never returns
      empty string now.  Added missing hashlimit parameters to the
      rule options tooltip. Some of the more rarely used hashlimit
      parameters are still not included in the tooltip. Improved
      tooltip formatting using html table.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1463 Always show branch rule set name with action "Branch"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1469 some actions should always display argument, even
      when text labels for actions and directions is off
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      applied patch by Vadim Jukov &lt;persgray@gmail.com&gt;,
      maintainer of OpenBSD port. Patch fixes compile issues on
      OpenBSD
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1468 Open new object in the editor after it has been
      created.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #1466 Implemented instrumentation that should help us
      improve user experience. Will track few things that new users do
      (or don't do) and report as a combination of boolean flags at
      the end of the GUI session. Reporting things such as if user
      ever looked at the "Getting Started" tutorial, if they created
      their first firewall object, modified any rules, tried to
      compile, install or import existing rule set. Information passed
      in the report is strictly a set of boolean flags, it is not
      identifiable and does not reveal what firewall platform they are
      using or anything about their objects and rules. List of flags
      is listed in the module UserWorkflow.h
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1478 always use included antlr run-time library. Because
      of the fixes I've made in CircularQueue?.hpp in 2008 for 64 bit
      systems, we should always link with antlr run-time that is
      included with fwbuilder code tree rather than attempt to use the
      one that might be installed with the OS.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1481 when user changes platform in the firewall object,
      its version should change too.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      added mechanism for one-time announcements that can be pulled
      from the web site when version check server says there is
      one. Announcement is shown only once. To do this, I store time
      stamp when it was shown in settings using hash of the
      announcement url.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      refs #1483 If program detects change in CustomService object and
      the change just adds code string for a platform that was not in
      the object in the user's data file, the change is accepted
      without showing the dialog.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #1484 "paste below" function pastes rules out of order
    </p>
  </li>
    

</ul>


<a name="importer"></a>
<h2>Changes in the policy importer</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      See #1450 and SourceForge ticket 3000809: iptables parser can
      now import "mark" module matches with hexadecimal parameters and
      "length" module matches. Also added check in the importer for
      broken iptables-save files where rules for any table are not
      terminated with "COMMIT".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #1453 "iptables importer should parse multiport module
      parameter --ports". Module multuport with parameter "--ports"
      matches either source or destination port numbers. Importer
      creates two tcp (or udp) service objects to implement this
      match.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #1451 "policy importer should support some popular iptables
      modules". Added support for module "recent" and rules that match
      standard ip/icmp/udp/tcp protocols and at the same time module
      "mark", "length", "limit" or "recent".  Rules like these are
      translated into a combination of a branching rule and additional
      rule in a branch rule set that implements module match.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>



<a name="standard_obj"></a>
<h2>Changes in the Standard Objects library</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1483 "missing code in the custom service object
      ESTABLISHED for ProCurve"
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>




<a name="libfwbuilder"></a>
<h2>Changes in libfwbuilder library</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1485 "dns name object is recognized
      as an empty group when it appears in shared rule set"
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<a name="procurve"></a>
<h2>Support for HP ProCurve</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Added experimental support for HP ProCurve "intelligent"
      switches (L3). Code is based on the policy compiler for Cisco
      IOS extended access lists. Differences include ';' character for
      comments, different naming convention for Vlan interfaces ("VLAN
      2", with a space), requirement to unbind an ACL from interface
      before it can be cleared, different syntax for vlan ACLs and
      ACLs bound to switch ports.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      At the time of the release of v4.0.1, we were able to test code
      generation for ProCurve ACL but policy installer remains
      untested for the lack of hardware. We are going to work on the
      installer over the next few months to make sure it works in the
      next point version release of fwbuilder.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>






<a name="iptables"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for iptables</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1455 Function update_addresses() (host OS linux24 and
      derivatives) uses both ip and ifconfig. Should stick with
      /sbin/ip so the script works on systems where ifconfig is not
      installed.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1458 Should permit interface name "br-lan" for bridge
      interface on Linux. Bridge interfaces on Linux can have any
      name, including those with "-". OpenWRT creates bridge interface
      with the name "br-lan" by default.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>



<a name="dd-wrt"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for DD-WRT</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #1448 "need to commit nvram changes on DD-WRT".
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>




<a name="ios"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for for Cisco IOS ACL</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Compiler uses new configlet "safety_net" to add temporary ACL for
      the "safety net" install method.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      restored function of the "comment the code" in the "Script
      options" of the firewall settings dialog for Cisco IOS ACL and
      ProCurve ACL. When this checkbox is off, comments are not
      added to generated script.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
