<h2>GUI Updates</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2685 "Clicking "Manage Members" in a vlan subinterface of a
      cluster causes crash".
    </p>
  </li>

<h2>Changes in support for iptables</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug #3468358 "change in rule-compilation between 5.0.0
      and 5.0.1". Rule with cluster interface in "Destination"
      should compile into matching ip addresses assigned to the cluster
      interface object and corresponding member firewall's interface
      object, but in v5.0.1 it only matched member interface
      address. This bug triggered when iptables version was set to
      1.2.11 or greater. This was a regression from v5.0.0
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2686 "automatic rules for heartbeat are not generated for
      vlan subinterfaces"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2684 "fix address deletion in configlet
      update_addresses".  This only applies to Linux firewalls and
      configurations where an interface has two or more ip
      addresses. If user deleted one of the addresses that happens to
      be the "primary" address of the interface in the GUI, generated
      script deleted both addresses on the firewall machine instead of
      just one and left interface with no addresses at all. The fix is
      to use /proc variable
      /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/promote_secondaries that makes the
      kernel "promote" secondary address to a "primary" status when
      primary address is deleted. Default behavior in Linux kernel is
      to delete all addresses when primary address is deleted.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      using mktemp to create temporary directory in the generated
      script. If mktemp is not available, fall back onto less secure
      but guaranteed to work method where I generate randomized the
      name of the temporary directory using process ID.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes SF bug 3489096 "dd-wrt-jffs: all routes are deleted if
      there is an error". The problem affects all supported Linux-like
      systems. Shell code that restores old static routing table
      entries in case of an error with commands adding new routing
      entries was broken and left the machine with no routes at all.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Other changes</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      fix for SF bug #3468802.  Need to define macro
      __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS. This still needs to be tested on all build
      machines.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      running autoconf, configure as part of windows build. Merged
      qmake .pro and .inc files for Windows, Mac and Linux
      builds. Moved files needed for Windows and Mac packaging to the
      "packaging" directory.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
