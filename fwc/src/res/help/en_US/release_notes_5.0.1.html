<h2>GUI Updates</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      moved "batch install" button from the main installer wizard to
      the dialog where user enters their password. Now user can start
      in a non-batch install mode but continue in batch install mode
      at any time if all their firewalls authenticate with the same
      user name and password.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #2628 fixed crash that happened if user create new firewall
      object from a template and changed one of the ip addresses,
      while another firewall object created from the same template
      already existed in the tree.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #2635 Object type AttachedNetworks is not allowed in the
      "interface" rule element.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      The drop-down list of interfaces for the "route-through" rule
      option for PF and iptables should include not only cluster
      interfaces, but also interfaces of all members. This way, we can
      make compiler generate configuration "pass in quick on em0
      route-to { ( em0 10.1.1.2 ) } ... " for a rule of a PF
      cluster. Here "em0" is an interface of a member, not the
      cluster.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2642 "GUI crashes if user cancels newFirewall dialog".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2641 "newFirewall dialog does not accept ipv6 addresses
      with long prefixes". The dialog did not allow ipv6 addresses of
      inetrfaces with netmask > 64 bit.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2643 "GUI crashes when user cuts a rule, then right-mouse
      click in any rule element of another"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      added check to make sure user does not enter netmask with zeroes
      in the middle for the IPv4 network object. Netmasks like that
      are not supported by fwbuilder.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2648 "right mouse click on firewall object in "Deleted
      objects" library causes GUI crash"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes SF bug 3388055 Adding a "DNS Name" with a trailing space
      causes failure.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes SF bug 3302121 "cosmetic mis-format in fwb Linux paths
      dialog"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes SF bug 3247094 "Nomenclature of IP address edit dialog".
      Network ipv6 dialog says "Prefix length".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #2654 fixes GUI crash that occured if user copied a rule
      from file A to file B, then closed file B, opened file C and
      tried to copy the same rule from A to C'
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #2655 Interface names are not allowed to have dash "-" even
      with interface verification off. We should allow "-" in the
      interface name for Cisco IOS
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #2657 snmp network discovery crashed if option "Confine scan
      to network" was used.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2658 "snmp network discovery creates duplicate address
      and network objects"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      enable fwbuilder to take advantage of GSSAPIAuthentication with
      openssh using suggestion by Matthias Witte witte@netzquadrat.de
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed a bug (no number): if the file name user entered in
      "Output file name" field in the "advanced settings" dialog of a
      firewall object ended with a white space, policy installer failed
      with an error "No such file or directory"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug #3433587 "Manual edit of new service Destination
      Port END value fails". This bug made it impossible to edit the
      value of the end of the port range because as soon as the value
      became less than the value of the beginning the range, the GUI
      would reset it to be equal to the value of the beginning of the
      range. This affected both TCP and UDP service object dialogs.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2665 "Adding text to comment causes rule to go from 2
      rows to 1 row". Under certain circumstances, editing rule
      comment caused the GUI to collapse corresponding row in the rule
      set view so that only the first object of each rule element that
      contained several objects was visible.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2669 "Cant inspect custom Service object in Standard
      objects library".
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Changes in policy importer for all supported platforms</h2>

<h3>Changes that affect import of PIX configurations</h3>
<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      changed token name from "ESP" to "ESP_WORD" to avoid conflict
      with macro "ESP" that happened during build on OpenSolaris
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #2662 "Crash when compiling ASA rule with IP range". Need to
      split address range if it is used in "source" of a rule that
      controls telnet, ssh or http to the firewall itself and
      firewall's version is &gt;= 8.3.  Commands "ssh", "telnet" and
      "http" (those that control access on the corresponding protocols
      to the firewall itself) accept only ip address of a host or a
      network as their argument. They do not accept address range,
      named object or object group. This is so at least as of ASA
      8.3. Since we expand address ranges only for versions &lt; 8.3
      and use named object for 8.3 and later, we need to make this
      additional check and still expand address ranges in rules that
      will later convert to "ssh", "telnet" or "http"
      command. Compiler still generates redundant object-group
      statement with CIDR blocks generated from the address range but
      does not use this group in the rule. This does not break
      generated configuration but the object-group is redundant since
      it is never used. This will be rectified in future versions.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2668 Remove "static routes" from the explanation text in
      ASA/PIX import dialog.  We can not import PIX/ASA routing
      configuration at this time.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2677 Policy importer for PIX/ASA could not parse command
      "nat (inside) 1 0 0"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2679 Policy importer for PIX/ASA could not import "nat
      exemption" rule (for example: "nat (inside) 0 access-list
      EXEMPT")
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2678 Policy importer
      for PIX/ASA could not parse nat command with parameter "outside"
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="libfwbuilder"></a>
<h2>Changes and improvements in the API library libfwbuilder</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      function InetAddr::isValidV4Netmask() checks that netmask
      represented by the object consists of a sequence of "1" bits,
      followed by the sequence of "0" bits and therefore does not have
      zeroes in the middle.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed bug #2670. Per RFC3021 network with netmask /31 has no
      network and direct broadcast addresses. When interface of the
      firewall is configured with netmask /31, policy compilers should
      not treat the second address of this "subnet" as a broadcast.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>





<!-- ######################################################################### -->
<a name="iptables"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for iptables</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #2639 "support for vlan subinterfaces of bridge interfaces
      (e.g.  br0.5)". Currently fwbuilder can not generate script to
      configure vlan subinterfaces of bridge interfaces, however if
      user did not request this configuration script to be generated,
      compiler should not abort when it encounters this combination.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2650 "rules with address range that includes firewall
      address in Src are placed in OUTPUT chain even though addresses
      that do not match the firewall should go in FORWARD"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes SF bug #3414382 "Segfault in fwb_ipt dealing with empty
      groups". Compiler for iptables used to crash when an empty group
      was used in the "Interface" column of a policy rule.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see SF bug #3416900 "Replace `command` with `which`".  Generated
      script (Linux/iptables) used to use "command -v" to check if
      command line tools it needs are present on the system. This was
      used to find iptables, lsmod, modprobe, ifconfig, vconfig,
      logger and others. Some embedded Linux distributions, notably
      TomatoUSB, come without support for "command". Switching to
      "which" that is more ubuquitous and should be available pretty
      much everywhere.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #2663 "Rule with "old-broadcast" object results in invalid
      iptables INPUT chain".  Compiler was choosing chain INPUT with
      direction "outbound" for rules that had old broadcast address in
      "Source", this lead to invalid iptables configuration with chain
      INPUT and "-o eth0" interface match clause.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed bug in the rule processor that replaces AddressRange
      object that represents single address with an IPv4 object. Also
      eliminated code redundancy.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes #2664 Update error message when "which" command
      fails. Generated iptables script uses "which" to check if all
      utilities it uses exist on the machine.  We should also check if
      "which" itself exists and issue meaningful error message if not.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      SF bug #3439613.  physdev module does not allow --physdev-out
      for non-bridged traffic anymore. We should add
      --physdev-is-bridged to make sure this matches only bridged
      packets. Also adding "-i" / "-o" clause to match parent bridge
      interface. This allows us to correctly match which bridge the
      packet comes through in configurations using wildcard bridge
      port interfaces. For example, when br0 and br1 have "vnet+"
      bridge port interface, iptables can still correctly match which
      bridge the packet went through using "-o br0" or "-o br1"
      clause. This can be useful in installations with many bridged
      interfaces that get created and destroyed dynamically, e.g.
      with virtual machines. Note that the "-i br0" / "-o br0" clause
      is only added when there is more than one bridge interface and
      bridge port name ends with a wild card symbol "+"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug #3443609 Return of ID: 3059893": iptables "--set"
      option deprecated".  Need to use --match-set instead of --set if
      iptables version is >= 1.4.4. The fix done for #3059893 was only
      in the policy compiler but needs to be done in both policy and
      nat compilers.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>

<a name="pf"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for PF (FreeBSD, OpenBSD)</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #2636 "carp : Incorrect output in rc.conf.local
      format". Should use create_args_carp0 instead of ifconfig_carp0
      to set up CARP interface vhid, pass and adskew parameters.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #2638 "When CARP password is empty the advskew value is not
      read". Should skip "pass <word>" parameter of the ifconfig
      command that creates carp interface if user did not set up any
      password.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug #3429377 "PF: IPv6 rules are not added in IPv4/IPv6
      ruleset (anchor)". Compiler for PF did not inlcude rules
      generated for IPv6 in generated PF anchor configuration files.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug 3428992: "PF: rules order problem with IPv4 and
      IPv6". Compiler for PF should group ipv4 and ipv6 NAT rules
      together, before it generates ipv4 and ipv6 policy rules.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      Several fixes in the algorithms used to process rules when
