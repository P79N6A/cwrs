<h2>Rule options for PF policy rules</h2>

<a name="general"/>
<h2>Tab General</h2>

<h3>Stateless rule</h3>

<p>
  Firewall Builder always uses stateful packet inspection if it is
  available in the target firewall. In case of PF, this means using
  "keep state" option for PF 3.x. In PF 4.x, combination "flags S/SA
  keep state" is the default so fwbuilder does not add it explicitly
  to the generated pf configuration. However, sometimes it might be
  desirable to create a rule without state matching. Checking this
  checkbox on makes the rule stateless and forces compiler to add
  "no state" clause to the generated pf configuration line.
</p>

<h3>Add 'keep state'</h3>

<p>
In PF 4.x, "flags S/SA keep state" is the default. Compiler will omit
these flags while generating code for stateful rules matching TCP
services. However, according to the PF FAQ, care should be taken while
dealing with states and interface enc0. To avoid leaking unencrypted
traffic out, the FAQ recommends setting 'keep state' explicitly in all
rules on the enc0 interface. This option applies only if version is
set to 4.x.

<h2>Tab Logging</h2>

<h3>Log prefix</h3>

<p>
  This option translates into "label " in the generated pf
  configuration.  Firewall Builder supports the following macros in
  the log prefix that are expanded at the compile time:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>%N rule number in the GUI. </li>
    <li>%A rule action </li>
    <li>%I interface the rule is associated with </li>
    <li>%C (iptables only) iptables chain that this rule generated 
      code for. </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Tab Tracking</h2>

<h3>Activate source tracking</h3>

<p>
  This checkbox enables using <b>max-src-nodes</b>
  and <b>max-src-states</b> options that can be configured using other
  elements in this page of the dialog.
</p>

<h3>Maximum number of source addresses...</h3>

<p>
  This option translates into <b>max-src-nodes</b> parameter.  It
  limits the maximum number of source addresses which can
  simultaneously have state table entries.
</p>


<h3>Maximum number of simultaneous state entries...</h3>

<p>
  This option translates into <b>max-src-states</b> parameter. It
  limits the maximum number of simultaneous state entries that a
  single source address can create with this rule.
</p>

           

<a name="limits"/>
<hr>
<h2>Tab Limits</h2>

<h3>Maximum number of concurrent states...</h3>


<p>
  This parameter translates into "max &lt;number&gt;". It limits the
  number of concurrent states the rule may create.  When this limit is
  reached, further packets that would create state will not match this
  rule until existing states time out.
</p>


<h3>Maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections...</h3>

<p>
  This parameter translates into "max-src-conn &lt;number&gt;". It
  limits the maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections which have
  completed the 3-way handshake that a single host can make.
</p>


<h3>The limit of new connections over a time interval ... / ... sec</h3>

<p>
  These parameters translate into "max-src-conn-rate &lt;number&gt; /
  &lt;seconds&gt;". They limit the rate of new connections over a time
  interval.  The connection rate is an approximation calculated as a
  moving average.
</p>


<h3>Overload table</h3>

<p>
  this parameter translates into "overload" in the generated pf
  configuration and can be used to create a table with given name.
  Source IP addresses which hit either of the limits on established
  connections will be added to the named table.  This table can be
  used in the ruleset to block further activity from the offending
  host, redirect it to a tarpit process, or restrict its bandwidth.
</p>

<p>
  To use this table in the rules, create Address Table object with the
  same name and leave the file name in that object blank. Then use
  this object in policy rules of the firewall as usual.
</p>


<a name="tcp"/>
<hr>
<h2>Tab TCP</h2>

<h3>Modulate state</h3>

<p>
  When this checkbox is checked, it makes compiler add "modulate
  state" clause to generated pf configuration.
</p>

<p>
  This option makes pf randomize TCP initial sequence numbers (ISN) of
  the TCP sessions opened through the firewall, thus improving
  protection against ISN guessing attacks. See man page for pf.conf
  for more details.
</p>


<h3>synproxy</h3>

<p>
  This parameter translates to the "synproxy" option in generated pf
  configuration. The synproxy state option can be used to cause pf
  itself to complete the handshake with the active endpoint, perform a
  handshake with the passive endpoint, and then forward packets
  between the endpoints. See man page for pf.conf for more details.
</p>


<h3>Use sloppy TCP state tracker for this rule</h3>

<p>
  This parameter translates into "sloppy" parameter in generated pf
  configuration.  From pf.conf man page:
<blockquote>
  This makes pf use sloppy TCP connection tracker that
  does not check sequence numbers at all, which makes insertion and
  ICMP teardown attacks way easier.  This is intended to be used in
  situations where one does not see all packets of a connection,
  e.g. in asymmetric routing situations.  Cannot be used with modulate
  or synproxy state.
