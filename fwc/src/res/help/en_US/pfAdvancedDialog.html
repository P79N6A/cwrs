<h2>Tab Compiler</h2>
<p>
  
  <h3>Compiler</h3>
<p>
  Full path to the policy compiler executable. Use this if you do not
  want to use standard Firewall Builder policy compiler that comes
  with the package or if you want to wrap compiler in a script.


  <h3>Command line options for the compiler</h3>
<p>
  Additional command line options for the policy compiler.


  <h3>Output file name</h3>
<p>
  Specify the name of the generated iptables script. If left blank, the
  file name is constructed from the firewall object name and extension
  ".fw".
</p>

<h3>Script name on the firewall</h3>
<p>
  Generated script will be copied to the firewall using this name. Can
  be full absolute path as well.
</p>

<p>
  Installation process is controlled by several variables that the
  user can change in the "advanced" dialog for the firewall platform:
</p>

<p>
<b>Tab "Compiler":</b>
<ul>
  <li>output file name</li>
  <li>script name on the firewall</li>
  <li> .conf file name on the firewall</li>
</ul>

<p/>

<b>Tab "Installer":</b>
<ul>
  <li>directory on the firewall where script should be installed</li>
  <li>command that installer should execute on the firewall</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  These variables have default values if input fields are left blank
  in the dialog:
</p>

<p>
  <b>Output file name</b>: the name of the firewall object, plus
  extension ".fw".
</p>

<p>
  <b>Script name on the firewall</b>: the same as the output file name
</p>

<p>
  <b>directory on the firewall</b>: "/etc"   (tab "Installer")
</p>

<p>
  <b>command that installer executes to activate policy</b>: installer runs
  script &lt;firewall&gt;.fw
</p>

<p>
  If user enters alternative name in the "script name on the
  firewall", it is used when generated script is copied to the
  firewall. There are two input fields in the dialogs for PF and ipf
  where user can enter alternative name for the .fw script and .conf
  file. The name can be relative or absolute path. If it is a relative
  path or just a file name, it is treated as a file name in the
  directory specified by the "directory on the firewall" input field
  in the "Installer" tab. If the name is an absolute path, the
  directory entered in "directory on the firewall..." input field is
  ignored.  If user entered alternative name for the script on the
  firewall, the command that installer should execute to activate it
  must be entered as well. If the alternative name was entered as an
  absolute path, activation command should take this into account and
  use the same absolute path. The command can start with "sudo " if
  user account used to copy and activate policy is not root.
</p>




<h3>Accept TCP sessions opened prior to firewall restart</h3>
<p>
  If this option is ON, the firewall will accept TCP sessions opened
  before the firewall software has been activated. These sessions are
  special because the firewall never saw their initiation phase.  If
  this option is on, the firewall creates an entry in the state table
  when it sees a packet that apparently belongs to the unknown TCP
  session.
<p>
  For PF 4.x this option adds "flags any" parameters to rules that
  match TCP services. PF 4.x by default behaves as if "flags S/SA"
  parameter was added to all rules matching TCP services. Adding
  "flags any" makes rule match not only TCP packets with SYN flag set
  and ACK flag cleared, which is the packet that initiates the
  session, but also packets with any other combination of flags,
  including just ACK flag set. Firewall will see packets like that
  when session opened before firewall software was restarted and
  session table cleared hit it.
<p>
  for PF 3.x the behavior of the policy compiler is opposite: when
  this option is not set, it adds "flags S/SA" to all rules that match
  any TCP services; if this option is set, "flags" parameter is not
  added to these rules at all, which makes them match TCP packets with
  any combination of flags.


  <h3>Modulate state for all stateful rules</h3>
<p>
  This adds "modulate state" parameter to rules that match any TCP
  services. Quoting man pf.conf(5), section <b>STATE MODULATION</b>:
  <blockquote>
    Much of the security derived from TCP is attributable to how well
     the initial sequence numbers (ISNs) are chosen.  Some popular
     stack implementations choose very poor ISNs and thus are normally
     susceptible to ISN prediction exploits.  By applying a
    <i>modulate state</i> rule to a TCP connection, pf(4) will
     create a high quality random sequence number for each connection
     endpoint.
    <p>
      The <i>modulate state</i> directive implicitly keeps state on the
      rule and is only applicable to TCP connections.
    </p>
    <p>
     For instance:
     <p>
       <pre>
           block all
           pass out proto tcp from any to any modulate state
           pass in  proto tcp from any to any port 25 flags S/SFRA modulate state
       </pre>
     </p>
     <p>
     Note that modulated connections will not recover when the state table is
     lost (firewall reboot, flushing the state table, etc...).  pf(4) will not
     be able to infer a connection again after the state table flushes the
     connection's modulator.  When the state is lost, the connection may be
     left dangling until the respective endpoints time out the connection.  It
     is possible on a fast local network for the endpoints to start an ACK
     storm while trying to resynchronize after the loss of the modulator.  The
     default flags settings (or a more strict equivalent) should be used on
    <i>modulate state</i> rules to prevent ACK storms.
     </p>
  </blockquote>


<h3>Detect shadowing in policy rules</h3>
<p>
  Rule shadowing happens when a certain rule is a super-set of a
  subsequent rule and any packets potentially matched by the
  subsequent rule have already been matched by the prior rule. For
  example, if rule #1 uses the network object for the source and rule
  #2 uses the host object located on that network for the source, rule
  #1 ’shadows’ rule #2 because any packet matched by #1 will never be
  matched by #2. This may be important if, say, rule #1 permits and #2
  denies access to the same destination. If rule #1 ’shadows’ rule #2,
  then rule #2 will never fire. This situation is most often an error;
  the compiler can detect it and abort processing of the policy with
  an appropriate error message.


<h3>Ignore empty groups in rules</h3>
<p>
  Compiler supports special case when empty group is used in the
  policy rule and there are no other objects in the same rule
  element. Depending on the state of this option, it generates
  iptables commands as follows:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>OFF: Compiler treats such case as an error and stops
      processing. This is because group with no objects is equivalent
      to an empty rule element ("source" or "destination"), but empty
      rule element is normally considered to be equal to "any". To
      avoid errors this may cause, compiler considers this situation
      an error.</li>
    <li>ON: A group with no objects in it never matches any packets,
    thus rendering the rule useless. When this option is turned on,
      compiler just throws such rule away.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is useful when one needs to control access to/from a group of
    hosts which may change and sometimes becomes empty. When this
    option is turned on, compiler will automatically disable the rule
    if the group becomes empty. Group contents can be managed manually
    or by a script using fwbedit command line tool.


<h3>Always permit ssh access from the management station with given address</h3>
<p>
  When this option is checked, compiler adds rules to permit ssh
  access to the firewall from the specified address block. Rules are
  placed at the very beginning of the policy to make sure ssh access
  is permitted even if there is an error in the policy which otherwise
  would block it. Added rules permit packets that match both NEW and
  ESTABLISHED states to avoid breaking ssh sessions that were already
  established.



<a name="scrub-rule-options">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Scrub rule options</h2>
<p>
  Compiler adds rules <b><i>"scrub in all [options]"</i></b> and
  <b><i>"scrub out all [options]"</i></b> at the top of generated
  pf.conf file. This dialog tab controls options added to this rule.

  
  <h3>Clear DF bit</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"scrub out all no-df"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Clears the dont-fragment bit from a matching IP packet.  Some
    operating systems are known to generate fragmented packets with
    the dont-fragment bit set.  This is particularly true with NFS.
    Scrub will drop such fragmented dont-fragment packets unless no-df
    is specified.
    <p>
      Unfortunately some operating systems also generate their dont-
      fragment packets with a zero IP identification field.  Clearing
      the dont-fragment bit on packets with a zero IP ID may cause
      deleterious results if an upstream router later fragments the
      packet.  Using the random-id modifier (see below) is recommended
      in combination with the no-df modifier to ensure unique IP
      identifiers.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</p>
      <p>This option is only used with <b><i>scrub out all</i></b>
      rule and therefore applies to all packets sent or forwarded by
      the firewall.
      </p>


  <h3>Use random ID</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"scrub out all random-id"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Replaces the IP identification field with random values to
    compensate for predictable values generated by many hosts.  This
    option only applies to packets that are not fragmented after the
    optional fragment reassembly.
  </blockquote>
</p>
      <p>This option is only used with <b><i>scrub out all</i></b>
      rule and therefore applies to all packets sent or forwarded by
      the firewall.
      </p>




  <h3>Enforce Minimum TTL</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"scrub out all min-ttl"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Enforces a minimum TTL for matching IP packets.
  </blockquote>
</p>
      <p>This option is only used with <b><i>scrub out all</i></b>
      rule and therefore applies to all packets sent or forwarded by
      the firewall.
      </p>



  <h3>Enforce Maximum MSS</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"scrub out all max-mss"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Enforces a maximum MSS for matching TCP packets.
  </blockquote>
</p>
      <p>This option is only used with <b><i>scrub out all</i></b>
      rule and therefore applies to all packets sent or forwarded by
      the firewall.
      </p>




  <h3>Reassemble fragments</h3>
<p>
  Enables the following three options that control fragment
  reassembly options.
      

  <h3>Buffer and reassemble fragments</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"scrub in all fragment reassemble"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Using scrub rules, fragments can be reassembled by normalization.
    In this case, fragments are buffered until they form a complete
    packet, and only the completed packet is passed on to the filter.
    The advantage is that filter rules have to deal only with complete
    packets, and can ignore fragments.  The drawback of caching
    fragments is the additional memory cost.  But the full reassembly
    method is the only method that currently works with NAT.  This is
    the default behavior of a scrub rule if no fragmentation modifier
    is supplied.
  </blockquote>
</p>
      <p>This option is only used with <b><i>scrub in all</i></b> rule.
      </p>



  <h3>Drop duplicate fragments, do not buffer and reassemble</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"scrub in all fragment crop"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    The default fragment reassembly method is expensive, hence the
    option to crop is provided.  In this case, pf(4) will track the
    fragments and cache a small range descriptor.  Duplicate
    fragments are dropped and overlaps are cropped.  Thus data will
    only occur once on the wire with ambiguities resolving to the
    first occurrence.  Unlike the fragment reassemble modifier,
    fragments are not buffered, they are passed as soon as they are
    received.  The fragment crop reassembly mechanism does not yet
    work with NAT.
  </blockquote>
</p>
      <p>This option is only used with <b><i>scrub in all</i></b> rule.
      </p>



  <h3>Drop duplicate and subsequent fragments</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"scrub in all fragment drop-ovl"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    This option is similar to the fragment crop modifier except that
    all overlapping or duplicate fragments will be dropped, and all
    further corresponding fragments will be dropped as well.
  </blockquote>
</p>
      <p>This option is only used with <b><i>scrub in all</i></b> rule.
      </p>



<a name="limits">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Limits</h2>
<p>
  Compiler adds rule <b><i>"set limit [options]"</i></b> at the top of
  generated pf.conf file. This dialog tab controls options added to
  this rule.



  <h3>Reassembly pool</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"set limit frags NNN"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Sets the maximum number of entries in the memory pool used for
    fragment reassembly (generated by scrub rules)
  </blockquote>
</p>



  <h3>State table size</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"set limit states"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Sets the maximum number of entries in the memory pool used by
    state table entries (generated by pass rules which do not specify
    no state).
  </blockquote>
</p>



  <h3>Src-nodes</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"set limit src-nodes"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Sets the maximum number of entries in the memory pool used for
    tracking source IP addresses (generated by the sticky-address and
    src.track options)
  </blockquote>
</p>



  <h3>Tables</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"set limit tables"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Sets limits on the memory pools used by tables.  <b><i>"set limit
        tables"</i></b> sets the number of tables that can exist.
  </blockquote>
</p>



  <h3>Table-entries</h3>
<p>
  Translates into <b>"set limit table-entries"</b>
<p>
  From man pf.conf(5):
<p>
  <blockquote>
    Sets limits on the memory pools used by tables.  <b><i>"set limit
        tables-entries"</i></b> sets the number of addresses that can
        be stored in tables.
  </blockquote>
</p>




<a name="timeouts">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Timeouts</h2>
<p>
  Compiler adds rule <b><i>"set timeout [options]"</i></b> at the top
  of generated pf.conf file. This dialog tab controls options added to
  this rule. See man pf.conf(5) for explanation.



<a name="installer">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Installer</h2>
<p>

  <h3>Directory on the firewall where script should be installed</h3>
<p>
  Installer will try to put generated script in /etc on the firewall,
  unless this option specify different location

  

  <h3>User name used to authenticate to the firewall</h3>
<p>
  This can be root or any regular user name. See "How to use built-in policy installer" on the web site at <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/guides/firewall_builder_howtos.html">http://www.fwbuilder.org/guides/firewall_builder_howtos.html</a>


  <h3>Alternative name or address used to communicate with the firewall</h3>
<p>
  Normally installer uses address of the interface marked as
  "management" to communicate with the firewall. Note that installer
  uses IP address rather than run DNS query for its name. You can
  specify different IP address in this option if necessary.



  <h3>Command that installer should execute on the firewall to activate the policy</h3>
<p>
  If this option is blank, installer copies script produces by the
  policy compiler to the firewall and executes it there. If this
  option defines different command, installer copies generated script
  and then runs this command. 


  <h3>Additional command line parameters to ssh</h3>
<p>
  This can be useful if you want to use alternative port for the ssh
  session to the firewall. Just put "-p PORT" here and this option
  will be appended to the ssh command line.


  <h3>External policy install script</h3>
<p>
  Put the full path to your own installer script here if you have one.


  <h3>Command line options for the script</h3>
<p>
  Command line options to the external installer script go here.





<a name="prolog-epilog">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Prolog/Epilog</h2>
<p>


  <h3>Insert prolog script ... </h3>
<p>
  you can control where exactly commands specified in Prolog and Epilog
  sections will be placed:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>in the activation shell script</b>: commands will be placed
      at the very beginning of the activation shell
      script <b><i>firewall.fw</i></b>
    </li>

    <li><b>in the pf rule file, at the very top</b>: commands will be
    added at the top of the generated .conf file
    </li>

    <li><b>in the pf rule file, after set commands</b>:commands will
    be added at the top of the generated .conf file after "set limit",
    "set timeout" commands but before "scrub" commands.
    </li>

    <li><b>in the pf rule file, after scrub commands</b>:commands will
    be added at the top of the generated .conf file after "scrub"
    commands but before table definitions
    </li>

    <li><b>in the pf rule file, after scrub commands</b>:commands will
    be added at the top of the generated .conf file after "table
    definitions" commands but before the first policy rule.
    </li>

  </ul>
  </p>



  <h3>Prolog section</h3>
<p>
  Add commands that you want compiler to insert into generated script
  here. Prolog section is added at the beginning of the script, before
  generated iptables commands. Note that generated iptables script is
  just a shell script, so commands you place in the Prolog and Epilog
  sections should be valid Bourne shell commands.



  <h3>Epilog section</h3>
<p>
  Epilog commands are added at the bottom of generated script, after
  iptables commands.



<a name="logging">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Logging</h2>
<p>

  <h3>Log Prefix:</h3>
<p>
  this translates into "label <text>" option in pf rules that request
  logging.



  <h3>Fallback "deny all" rule should log blocked packets</h3>
<p>
  Compiler adds policy rule at the bottom of the pf rule set that just
  denies all packets in and out. This is just a fallback rule that
  follows best practices in firewall policy design. Normally this rule
  blocks but does not log packets. This option makes it log.



<a name="script-options">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Script Options</h2>
<p>

  <h3>Turn debugging on in generated script</h3>
<p>
  This option makes the generated firewall script print all commands
  when it is executed. To do this, compiler adds "-x" to the shell
  command line at the top of the script. Command <i>pfctlc/ used to
  load PF rules into the kernel will also be given command line flag
  "-v".



  <h3>Configure interfaces of the firewall machine</h3>
<p>
  This option makes compiler add commands to configure IP addresses of
  the interfaces of the firewall according to the "Address" objects
  added to interfaces in the Firewall Builder GUI.



  <h3>Add virtual addresses for NAT</h3>
<p>
  The compiler can generate commands to add a virtual address to one
  of the interfaces of the firewall machine if this option is turned
  on. This is needed if a NAT rule uses an IP address that does not
  belong to any interface of the firewall. The firewall either needs
  the static ’published’ ARP entry for this address, or it should be
  added to one of the interfaces as an ’alias’ or virtual address.
  The policy compiler adds code to add an ’alias’ address to the
  interface on top of the firewall activation script.



  <h3>Flush pf states after reloading rules</h3>
<p>
  Compiler can add command "pfctl -F states" after command "pfctl -f
  file.conf" to flush states that existed in memory from sessions
  opened prior to the policy reload. The reason is that some of these
  sessions might be denied by the new policy, but if state is not
  flushed, they will still work after the policy has been
  reloaded. This is optional and is off by default.

<p>
  Note that ssh session used by the built-in installer to upload new
  pf configuration and activate it on the firewall is also subject to
  the state tracking and can hang if state is flushed. However,
  command added by the policy compiler when option "Always permit ssh
  access from the management station with given address" is used is
  immune to this.  This command is written in a such way that firewall
  will automatically restore the state used to track ssh session
  opened by the installer so it will never hang. This option is
  located in the tab "Compiler" of the same dialog.


<a name="ipv6">
<hr>
<h2>Tab IPv6</h2>
<p>

  <h3>Order in which IPv4 and IPv6 rules should be generated</h3>
<p>
  Compiler can place ipv6 policies before or after ipv4 rules. This
  option controls the order.
