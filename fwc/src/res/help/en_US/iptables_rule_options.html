<h2>Rule options for iptables policy rules</h2>

<a name="general">
<h2>Tab General</h2>

<h3>Assume firewall is part of 'any'</h3>

<p>
  This option overrides global setting of the option with the same
name in the firewall object "advanced" settings dialog.
</p>

<p>
  On some firewall platforms there is a difference in the
  configuration command used to control access through the firewall
  versus the command that controls access to the firewall itself. For
  example, in iptables, packets headed for the firewall machine should
  be inspected in the INPUT chain, while packets going through the
  firewall are inspected in the FORWARD chain. If this option is ON,
  the compiler generates code for both FORWARD and INPUT chains if it
  sees ’any’ as the destination of the policy rule. In other words, it
  assumes that the firewall is part of ’any’, and packets may either
  go to or through the firewall. If this option is off, the compiler
  only generates code for the FORWARD chain. Compiler treats ’any’ in
  the source of the rule in a similar way, generating code either for
  the OUTPUT and FORWARD, or only for the FORWARD chain.
</p>

<h3>Stateless rule</h3>
<p>
  Firewall Builder always uses stateful packet inspection if it is
  available in the target firewall. In case of iptables, this means it
  always uses module "state" by adding the following parameters to the
  generated rules: "-m state --state NEW". It also adds a rule to
  match states "ESTABLISHED,RELATED" on top of the policy. However,
  sometimes it might be desirable to create a rule without state
  matching. Checking this checkbox on makes the rule stateless, which
  means parameters "-m state --state NEW" will not be added.
</p>

<p>
  Rules with action Deny are always stateless by default and do not get
  the "-m state --state NEW" parameters, although you can make them
  stateful by checking this checkbox.

<a name="logging">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Logging</h2>

<p>
  Options in this tab override the same options configured globally in
  the firewall object "advanced" settings dialog.
</p>


<h3>Log prefix</h3>

<p>
  Log records will be prefixed with a string you enter in this option.
  Firewall Builder supports the following macros in the log prefix that
  are expanded at the compile time: 
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>%N rule number in the GUI. </li>
    <li>%A rule action </li>
    <li>%I interface the rule is associated with </li>
    <li>%C (iptables only) iptables chain that this rule generated 
      code for. </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h3>Log level</h3>

<p>
  Choose one of the standard syslog log levels for the "--log-level"
  option of the LOG iptables target.
</p>


<h3>Netlink group</h3>

<p>
  This specifies the netlink group (1-32) to which the packet is sent.
  Used to add "--ulog-nlgroup" parameter if ULOG logging is chosen in
  the firewall settings dialog, tab "Logging".
</p>


<a name="limit">
<hr>
<h2>Tab limit</h2>

<p>
  Options in this tab are used to configure parameters for the module
  "limit".
</p>

<h3>Rate, burst</h3>

<p>
  These translate into " --limit rate" and "--limit-burst number"
  options for the module "limit". If rate is set to 0 (the default),
  parameter "-m limit --limit rate" is not added to the generated
  iptables command.
</p>


<a name="connlimit">
<hr>
<h2>Tab connlimit</h2>

<p>
  Options in this tab are used to configure parameters for the module
  "connlimit".
</p>

<h3>Number of allowed connections per client host</h3>

<p>
  If this option is set to non-zero value, it adds the following
  clause to the generated iptables command: "-m
  connlimit --connlimit-above ".
</p>

<h3>...per network with netmask of ... </h3>

<p>
  If this option is set to non-zero value, it adds the following
  to the generated iptables command: " --connlimit-mask mask".
</p>

<p>
  Note that <b>conntrack</b> module must be compiled into the kernel
  and iptables in order for these options to work on the firewall.
</p>


<a name="hashlimit">
<hr>
<h2>Tab hashlimit</h2>

<p>
  Options in this tab are used to configure parameters for the module
  "hashlimit". Please see man page for iptables, section "hashlimit"
  for the explanation of all parameters it accepts. Note that on some
  older Linux systems this module used to be called
  "dstlimit". Checking corresponding checkbox in this dialog causes
  compiler to generate parameter as "-m dstlimit" instead of "-m
  hashlimit".
