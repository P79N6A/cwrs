<h2>Tab Compiler</h2>
<p>

<h3>Compiler</h3>
<p>
  Full path to the policy compiler executable. Use this if you do not
  want to use standard Firewall Builder policy compiler that comes
  with the package or if you want to wrap compiler in a script.
</p>

<h3>Command line options for the compiler</h3>
<p>
  Additional command line options for the policy compiler.
</p>

<h3>Output file name</h3>
<p>
  Specify the name of the generated iptables script. If left blank, the
  file name is constructed from the firewall object name and extension
  ".fw".
</p>

<h3>Script name on the firewall</h3>
<p>
  Generated script will be copied to the firewall using this name. Can
  be full absolute path as well.
</p>

<p>
  Installation process is controlled by several variables that the
  user can change in the "advanced" dialog for the firewall platform:
</p>

<p>
<b>Tab "Compiler":</b>
<ul>
  <li>output file name</li>
  <li>script name on the firewall</li>
</ul>

<p/>

<b>Tab "Installer":</b>
<ul>
  <li>directory on the firewall where script should be installed</li>
  <li>command that installer should execute on the firewall</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  These variables have default values if input fields are left blank
  in the dialog:
</p>

<p>
  <b>Output file name</b>: the name of the firewall object, plus
  extension ".fw".
</p>

<p>
  <b>Script name on the firewall</b>: the same as the output file name
</p>

<p>
  <b>directory on the firewall</b>: "/etc"   (tab "Installer")
</p>

<p>
  <b>command that installer executes to activate policy</b>: installer runs
  script &lt;firewall&gt;.fw
</p>

<p>
  If user enters alternative name in the "script name on the
  firewall", it is used when generated script is copied to the
  firewall. There are two input fields in the dialogs for PF and ipf
  where user can enter alternative name for the .fw script and .conf
  file. The name can be relative or absolute path. If it is a relative
  path or just a file name, it is treated as a file name in the
  directory specified by the "directory on the firewall" input field
  in the "Installer" tab. If the name is an absolute path, the
  directory entered in "directory on the firewall..." input field is
  ignored.  If user entered alternative name for the script on the
  firewall, the command that installer should execute to activate it
  must be entered as well. If the alternative name was entered as an
  absolute path, activation command should take this into account and
  use the same absolute path. The command can start with "sudo " if
  user account used to copy and activate policy is not root.
</p>

<h3>Assume firewall is part of 'any'</h3>
<p>
  On some firewall platforms there is a difference in the
  configuration command used to control access through the firewall
  versus the command that controls access to the firewall itself. For
  example, in iptables, packets headed for the firewall machine should
  be inspected in the INPUT chain, while packets going through the
  firewall are inspected in the FORWARD chain. If this option is ON,
  the compiler generates code for both FORWARD and INPUT chains if it
  sees "any" as the destination of the policy rule. In other words, it
  assumes that the firewall is part of "any", and packets may either
  go to or through the firewall. If this option is off, the compiler
  only generates code for the FORWARD chain. Compiler treats "any" in
  the source of the rule in a similar way, generating code either for
  the OUTPUT and FORWARD, or only for the FORWARD chain.
</p>


<h3>Accept TCP sessions opened prior to firewall restart</h3>
<p>
  If this option is ON, the firewall will accept TCP sessions opened
  before the firewall software has been activated. These sessions are
  special because the firewall never saw their initiation phase.  If
  this option is on, the firewall creates an entry in the state table
  when it sees a packet that apparently belongs to the unknown TCP
  session.
</p>


<h3>Accept ESTABLISHED and RELATED packets before the first rule</h3>
<p>
  This option generates an implicit rule to accept ESTABLISHED 
  and RELATED packets before the very first rule specified in the 
  GUI. This helps to reduce the size of the policy script generated 
  by the policy compiler. ESTABLISHED packets are basically 
  reply packets coming back from the server to the client. Iptables 
  keeps state information about each TCP session opened through 
  the firewall and thus can detect and permit these kind of packets 
  automatically. RELATED packets belong to another stream 
  somehow associated with the initial stream opened through the 
  firewall. FTP protocol is a good example of this situation. FTP 
  uses two TCP sessions: command channel and data channel. 
  You do not need to add a special rule for the data channel to 
  your policy because iptables "understands" when it needs to 
  permit packets that belong to the data channel that has been 
  created per request sent via a known command channel. This 
  option is ON by default. If for some reason you do not want to 
  have an implicit rule to permit these types of packets on top of 
  all the rules defined in the GUI, you should uncheck this option. 
  Remember that in this case you need to add a rule to permit 
  these types of packets yourself. You can use the Custom Service 
  object named "ESTABLISHED" in this rule. This service object 
  can be found in the "Standard" object tree. 
</p>

<h3>Drop packets that are associated with no known connection</h3>
<p>
  Add rule on top of the policy to match packets in state "INVALID"
  and drop them. This is implemented using iptables module state with
  option "--state INVALID". Additional checkbox makes generated script
  drop and log such packets.
</p>

<h3>Bridging firewall</h3>
<p>
  This option changes algorithms used by the policy compiler and makes
  it generate script for a bridging firewall. A bridging firewall treats
  broadcast packets differently, never uses INPUT and OUTPUT chains,
  and has some other differences.
</p>


<h3>Detect shadowing in policy rules</h3>
<p>
  Rule shadowing happens when a certain rule is a super set of a
  subsequent rule and any packets potentially matched by the
  subsequent rule have already been matched by the prior rule. For
  example, if rule #1 uses the network object for the source and rule
  #2 uses the host object located on that network for the source, rule
  #1 "shadows" rule #2 because any packet matched by #1 will never be
  matched by #2. This may be important if, say, rule #1 permits and #2
  denies access to the same destination. If rule #1 "shadows" rule #2,
  then rule #2 will never fire. This situation is most often an error;
  the compiler can detect it and abort processing of the policy with
  an appropriate error message.
</p>

<h3>Ignore empty groups in rules</h3>
<p>
  Compiler supports special case when empty group is used in the
  policy rule and there are no other objects in the same rule
  element. Depending on the state of this option, it generates
  iptables commands as follows:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>OFF: Compiler treats such case as an error and stops
      processing. This is because group with no objects is equivalent
      to an empty rule element ("source" or "destination"), but empty
      rule element is normally considered to be equal to "any". To
      avoid errors this may cause, compiler considers this situation
      an error.</li>
    <li>ON: A group with no objects in it never matches any packets,
    thus rendering the rule useless. When this option is turned on,
      compiler just throws such rule away.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  This is useful when one needs to control access to/from a group of
  hosts which may change and sometimes becomes empty. When this
  option is turned on, compiler will automatically disable the rule
  if the group becomes empty. Group contents can be managed manually
  or by a script using fwbedit command line tool.
</p>

<h3>Enable support for NAT of locally originated connections</h3>
<p>
  By default sessions initiated by the firewall are not considered
  subject to NAT and NAT rules are not placed in the OUTPUT
  chain. However if this option is checked, compiler finds NAT rules
  that can match sessions initiated by the firewall and places them in
  the OUTPUT chain as well.
</p>

<h3>Clamp MSS to MTU</h3>
<p>
  This adds a rule on top of the policy with iptables target TCPMSS
  and option --clamp-mss-to-pmtu which automatically clamps MSS value
  to (path_MTU - 40). This iptables rule is added only if IP
  forwarding is turned on in the host settings dialog. since IP
  forwarding for ipv4 and ipv6 can be configured separately, rules
  with target TCPMSS for iptables and ip6tables are also added
  separately if corresponding IP forwarding setting is
  enabled. Finally, this target is only available in ip6tables
  starting with version 1.3.8 and compiler will not add it to the
  generated script if version is set to less than "1.4.x" in the
  firewall object dialog.
</p>

<h3>Add rules to accept IPv6 Neighbor Discovery packets to IPv6 policies</h3>
<p>
  When this option is on, compiler will automatically add rules on top
  of the generated IPv6 script to permit ICMP6 types
  <i><b>router-solicitation</b></i>, <i><b>router-advertisement</b></i>, <i><b>neighbour-solicitation</b></i>,
  <i><b>neighbour-advertisement</b></i> (both INPUT and OUTPUT).
</p>

<h3>Default action on "Reject"</h3>
<p>
  This defines what kind of ICMP message will be send back to the
  sender if packet matches rule with action "Reject".
</p>

<h3>Always permit ssh access from the management station with given address</h3>
<p>
  When this option is checked, compiler adds rules to permit ssh
  access to the firewall from the specified address block. Rules are
  placed at the very beginning of the policy to make sure ssh access
  is permitted even if there is an error in the policy which otherwise
  would block it. Added rules permit packets that match both NEW and
  ESTABLISHED states to avoid breaking ssh sessions that were already
  established.
</p>

<h3>Install the rule for ssh access from the management workstation
  when the firewall is stopped</h3>

<p>
  Generated script recognizes command line arguments "start" and
  "stop". Running with argument "start" causes it to flush all
  iptables tables and rules and install rules defined in fwbuilder
  GUI. Running with argument "stop" causes the script to flush all
  tables and rules and set default policy for all chains to
  "DROP". This effectively shuts down the firewall for all kinds of
  traffic.  When this option is on, compiler adds rules to permit ssh
  access from the address defined in the previous option even when the
  firewall is stopped.
</p>


<a name="installer">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Installer</h2>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Directory on the firewall where script should be installed</h3>
<p>
  Installer will try to put generated script in /etc on the firewall,
  unless this option specify different location
</p>
  

<h3>User name used to authenticate to the firewall</h3>
<p>
  This can be root or any regular user name. See "How to use built-in policy installer" on the web site at <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/guides/firewall_builder_howtos.html">http://www.fwbuilder.org/guides/firewall_builder_howtos.html</a>
</p>

<h3>Alternative name or address used to communicate with the firewall</h3>
<p>
  Normally installer uses address of the interface marked as
  "management" to communicate with the firewall. Note that installer
  uses IP address rather than run DNS query for its name. You can
  specify different IP address in this option if necessary.
</p>


<h3>Command that installer should execute on the firewall to activate the policy</h3>
<p>
  If this option is blank, installer copies script produces by the
  policy compiler to the firewall and executes it there. If this
  option defines different command, installer copies generated script
  and then runs this command. 
</p>

<h3>Additional command line parameters to ssh</h3>
<p>
  This can be useful if you want to use alternative port for the ssh
  session to the firewall. Just put "-p PORT" here and this option
  will be appended to the ssh command line.
</p>

<h3>External policy install script</h3>
<p>
  Put the full path to your own installer script here if you have one.
</p>

<h3>Command line options for the script</h3>
<p>
  Command line options to the external installer script go here.
</p>




<a name="prolog-epilog">
<hr>
<h2>Tab Prolog/Epilog</h2>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Prolog section</h3>
<p>
  Add commands that you want compiler to insert into generated script
  here. Prolog section is added at the beginning of the script, before
  generated iptables commands. Note that generated iptables script is
  just a shell script, so commands you place in the Prolog and Epilog
  sections should be valid Bourne shell commands.
</p>

<h3>Insert prolog script ... </h3>
<p>
  you can control where exactly commands specified in the Prolog
  section will be placed:
  <ul>
    <li><b>on top of the script</b>: commands will be placed at the very
    beginning, before anything else is done.
    </li>
    <li><b>After interface configuration</b>: commands will be added after
    interface configuration is done but before any iptables commands.
    </li>
    <li><b>After policy reset</b>: Policy is reset by setting default
    iptables targets to DROP in all tables and all chains and by
    purging all existing chains. If this option is chosen, prolog
    section goes after policy reset but before the first iptables
    commands.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h3>Epilog section</h3>
<p>
  Epilog commands are added at the bottom of generated script, after
  iptables commands.
</p>


<a name="logging">
  <hr>
  <h3>Tab Logging</h3>
<p>
</p>
  
<h3>use LOG</h3>
<p>
  Use target LOG for logging
</p>


<h3>log TCP seq. numbers</h3>
<p>
  <i>Available if target <b>LOG</b> is used for logging</i>. Log TCP sequence
  numbers. This is a security risk if the log is readable by users.
</p>


<h3>log TCP options</h3>
<p>
  <i>Available if target <b>LOG</b> is used for logging</i>. Log options from
  the TCP packet header.
</p>



<h3>log IP options</h3>
<p>
  <i>Available if target <b>LOG</b> is used for logging</i>. Log options from
  the IP packet header.
</p>


<h3>Use numeric syslog levels</h3>
<p>
<i>Available if target <b>LOG</b> is used for logging</i>.  Use numeric log
  levels instead of the names "debug", "info" etc. This option was
  added long time ago because of a bug in iptables and probably is not
  relevant any more.
</p>


<h3>Log level</h3>
<p>
<i>Available if target <b>LOG</b> is used for logging</i>.  This option
  refers to the syslog log level and is used with firewalls that
  support logging via the syslog protocol. Here is the list of the
  standard log levels: "debug", "info", "notice", "warning", "error ",
  "crit" and "alert"
</p>



<h3>queue threshold</h3>
<p>
  <i>Available if target <b>ULOG</b> is used for logging</i> Number of packet
  to queue inside kernel.  Setting this value to, e.g. 10 accumulates
  ten packets inside the kernel and transmits them as one netlink
  multipart message to userspace.  Default is 1 (for backwards
  compatibility).
</p>


<h3>netlink group</h3>
<p>
  <i>Available if target <b>ULOG</b> is used for logging</i> This specifies
 the netlink group (1-32) to which the packet is sent. Default value
 is 1.
</p>





<h3>Log prefix</h3>
<p>
  Log records will be prefixed with a string you enter in this option.
  Firewall Builder supports the following macros in the log prefix that
  are expanded at the compile time: 
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>%N rule number in the GUI. </li>
    <li>%A rule action </li>
    <li>%I interface the rule is associated with </li>
    <li>%C (iptables only) iptables chain that this rule generated 
      code for. </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h3>Logging limit</h3>
<p>
  Generated iptables rules use module "limit" to limit amount of log
  data they produce. You can limit logging to a given number of log
  records per unit of time.
</p>


<h3>Activate logging in all rules</h3>
<p>
  This makes all rules log, regardless of whether a rule requested
  logging or not. This may be useful for debugging but produces a lot
  of syslog data and should be used carefully.
</p>




<a name="script-options">
  <hr>
  <h3>Tab Script Options</h3>
<p>
</p>  

<h3>Load Modules</h3>
<p>
  Compiler adds commands to load all available iptables modules into
  kernel memory.
</p>

<h3>Turn debugging on in generated script</h3>
<p>
  This option makes the generated firewall script print all commands
  when it is executed. To do this, compiler adds "-x" to the shell
  command line at the top of the script.
</p>


<h3>Verify interfaces before loading firewall policy</h3>
<p>
  this option makes compiler add commands to check if all interfaces
  defined in the firewall object in the GUI really exist on the
  firewall machine. Generated policy is probably going to be incorrect
  and won't load because of iptables errors if it was generated for an
  interface that does not really exist.
</p>

<h3>Configure interfaces of the firewall machine</h3>
<p>
  This option makes compiler add commands to configure IP addresses of
  the interfaces of the firewall according to the "Address" objects
  added to interfaces in the Firewall Builder GUI.
</p>

<p>
  The script generated by fwbuilder v4.0 does not rely on special
  labels of the addresses as it did in previous versions. Also, in the
  past it purged all addresses and then added those defined in
  fwbuilder back. Script created by fwbuilder v4.0 does not purge
  addresses, instead it manages them incrementally.  First, it obtains
  the list of IP addresses of each interface and compares it with
  addresses defined in fwbuilder.  Then, it adds missing addresses to
  the interface and deletes addresses that are not configured in
  fwbuilder.
</p>

<h3>Clear IP addresses and bring down interfaces not configured in fwbuilder</h3>
<p>
  If this option is on, generated script will clear IP addresses and
  bring down interfaces of the firewall that have not been configured
  in the fwbuilder GUI. This can be used to ensure that the
  configuration of the firewall machine is perfectly synchronized with
  objects defined in fwbuilder. This function does nothing to
  interfaces configured in fwbuilder, regardless of their type
  ("regular", "dynamic" or "unnumbered"). Be careful using this
  option, especially in the early stages of building fwbuilder objects
  for the new firewall. If you forget to add an interface that is
  supposed to pass traffic to fwbuilder configuration, generated
  script will shut it down when this option is turned on. However when
  configuration has been debugged and is known to be correct, it may
  be useful to turn this option on to make fwbuilder completely take
  over management of firewall interfaces.
</p>

<h3>Configure VLAN interfaces</h3>
<p>
  When this option is on, generated script will use vconfig commands
  to configure vlan interfaces defined in the fwbuilder GUI. The
  script tries to do this incrementally, that is, it compares
  requested set of vlans with existing vlan interfaces on the machine,
  then it creates those that are missing and deletes those that are not
  defined in fwbuilder.
</p>

<h3>Configure bridge interfaces</h3>
<p>
  When this option is on, generated script will use brctl command to
  manage bridge and bridge ports. This is also done incrementally, by
  adding bridges and ports that are configured in fwbuilder but are
  missing on the machine and deleting those that exist on the machine
  but have not been defined in fwbuilder.
</p>

<h3>Configure bonding interfaces</h3>
<p>
  When this option is on, generated script will use ifenslave command
  to manage bonding interfaces. The script can manage bonding
  interface slaves incrementally as well.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately since bonding interfaces are created by the kernel
  module which is difficult to unload and load back reliably, the
  script can not change bonding parameters (arguments for the module)
  incrementally. However, the script includes commands that load
  "bonding" module with parameters defined in the fwbuilder GUI. The
  module will be loaded into the kernel with these parameters if the
  script runs after reboot. Bonding interface parameters are defined
  in the "Advanced Interface Settings" dialog of the bonding interface
  object.
</p>

<h3>Add virtual addresses for NAT</h3>
<p>
  The compiler can generate commands to add a virtual address to one
  of the interfaces of the firewall machine if this option is turned
  on. This is needed if a NAT rule uses an IP address that does not
  belong to any interface of the firewall. The firewall either needs
  the static "published" ARP entry for this address, or it should be
  added to one of the interfaces as an "alias" or virtual address.
  The policy compiler adds code to add an "alias" address to the
  interface on top of the firewall activation script.
</p>

<h3>Use iptables-restore to activate policy</h3>
<p>
  If this option is turned on, compiler generates firewall script in
  different format and uses <b>iptables-restore</b> script to load
  it. Both all iptables commands and the call
  to <b>iptables-restore</b> to load them are parts of the generated
  script, you just need to execute this script on the firewall. The
  advantage of this method is that operation of loading policy
  using <b>iptables-restore</b> is atomic, that is, either the whole
  the new policy loads into kernel memory, or none of it does. If new
  policy has syntax errors, it will not load. If generated script
  does not use <b>iptables-restore</b> to activate the policy, it may
  load partially if there is an error in one of the rules somewhere in
  the middle. Using <b>iptables-restore</b> helps avoid this problem.
</p>


<a name="ipv6">
  <hr>
  <h3>Tab IPv6</h3>
<p>
</p>
  
<h3>Order in which IPv4 and IPv6 rules should be generated</h3>
<p>
  Compiler can place ipv6 policies before or after ipv4 rules. This
  option controls the order.
</p>
