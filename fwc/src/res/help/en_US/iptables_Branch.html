<h2>Rule Action "Branch"</h2>

<p>
This action is used to create a branch in the rule set. For iptables
this action is translated into "-j" command line option with an
argument that points to a user-defined chain. To use this action,
create new Policy rule set object, then drag and drop it into a well
in the dialog of this action. Note that you can use policy rule set
object of another firewall as well.
