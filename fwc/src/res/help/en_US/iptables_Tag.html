<h2>Rule Action "Tag"</h2>

<p>
This action associates internal tag with the packet. Tag can later be
inspected using service object <b>TagService</b>. This action is
translated into MARK target with corresponding --set-mark parameter
and optionally additional rule with CONNMARK --save-mark target for
iptables. If option that activates CONNMARK target is used, compiler
also adds a rule at the very top of the policy to restore the
mark. Rules are placed in INPUT,OUTPUT and FORWARD chain of the
"mangle" table, this ensures that DNAT happens before rules placed in
the mangle table see the packet. PREROUTING chain in mangle table is
executed before PREROUTING chain in the nat table, so placing tagging
rules in the PREROUTING chain would make them fire before
DNAT. POSTROUTING chain of the mangle table, as well as its FORWARD
and OUTPUT chains, work before corresponding chains of the nat
table. In all cases the goal is to make sure DNAT rules process the
packet before, and SNAT rules process it after filtering and tagging
rules.

<p>
To use this action create <b>TagService</b> object with tag code you
want to use, then drag and drop it into the well in the action dialog.
