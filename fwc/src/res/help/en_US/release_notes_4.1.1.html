<h2>What's new in V4.1.1 ?</h2>


<p>
  This release includes fixes for a number of minor bugs as well being
  the first release to officially support HP ProCurve ACL
  configuration.  Thanks to a generous donation of several switches
  from Hewlett Packard we were able to test and finalize the ProCurve
  support.  This release also fixes a critical bug in V4.1 related to
  Cisco IOS ACL configurations.  Some configurations would cause
  Firewall Builder to incorrectly generate and error with the message
  "Can not find interface with network zone that includes address
  A.B.C.D.".
</p>

<p>
  v4.1.1 has been tested, and we believe it to be ready for production
  use, but if you do find a bug or issue please let us know.

<h2>GUI Updates</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      Built-in policy installer now works with HP Procurve
      switches. Currently installer can only execute generated
      configurarion lines one-by-one on the switch; installation
      method using scp that is available for Cisco routers is not
      supported yet. This has been tested with Procurve firmware
      K14.31 on ProCurve J9470A Switch 3500-24. Caveat: manager access
      should not be configured with user name (that is, no "password
      manager user-name foo")
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1683 When user creates new firewall using snmp scan,
      fwbuilder will now guess and assign the type to interfaces that
      look like vlans for the given platform and host OS.
      
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1683
      class procurveInterfaces interprets interface "DEFAULT_VLAN" as
      vlan interface with vlan id 1.      
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>




<a name="iptables"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for iptables</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1693 SF bug 3048516 "NAT rule with 'Use SNAT instead
      MASQ' doesn't work".  NAT rule using combination of the option
      "Use SNAT instead of MASQ", dynamic address of an interface and
      source port translation produced iptables command with incorrect
      syntax.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      see #1685 "iptables redirecting NAT rules in the OUTPUT
      chain". This fix makes it possible to create iptables NAT rule
      with target REDIRECT in the OUTPUT chain. The rule should have
      firewall object in OSrc and TDst rule elements.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1685 "iptables redirecting NAT rules in the OUTPUT
      chain". NAT rules should be allowed to translate from
      CustomService to TCP or UDP service, provided CustomService
      object is configured with matching protocol. 
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1686 "can not generate basic NAT branching rule". NAT
      branching rules were not generated in single rule compile mode
      because compiler needs information about targets used in the
      branch rule set rules to decide which chain the branching rule
      should be placed in. Now it will use PREROUTING and POSTROUTING
      in single compile mode but issue a warning.
    </p>
  </li>


</ul>



<a name="pf"></a>
<h2>Support for PF</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No changes support for PF in this release
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="ios"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for for Cisco IOS ACL</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1690 "IOS ACL and Procurve ACL compilers fail because
      interfaces are not assumed to have network zone any anymore".
      Compilers for Cisco IOS ACL and Procurve ACL always assumed all
      interfaces have network zone "any". Recent changes made in 4.1.0
      changed that and compilers stopped working for some rule
      configurations. This bug caused compiler to fail with error
      message "Can not find interface with network zone that includes
      address A.B.C.D"
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<a name="pix"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for for Cisco ASA (PIX)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No changes in support for PIX in this release
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>



<a name="procurve"></a>
<h2>Support for HP ProCurve</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1688 "Procurve ACL remarks should be in quotes if they
	include space"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1687 "temporary access list commands syntax is
      incorrect". Temporary ACL generated for the Procurve platform
      was incorrect.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Built-in installer has been tested and now works with
      ProCurve switches.
    </p>
  </li>


</ul>
