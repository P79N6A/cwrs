<!-- Highlights for this release -->

<a name="summary"></a>
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  In addition to bug fixes and minor enhancements, v 5.0 includes the
  following new features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>User defined system folders</li>
  <li>Keywords for tagging objects</li>
  <li>Dynamic Group Objects with Smart Filters</li>
  <li>Multiple operations per filter Rule</li>
  <li>New Attached Networks Object</li>
  <li>Improved GUI layout and behavior</li>
  <li>Import of PF configurations</li>
</ul>


<h3>User Defined System Folders</h3>

<p>
  Users can now create their own subfolders in the object tree. To add a subfolder 
  right-click on a system folder, for example Firewalls, and select "New Subfolder".
  You can move objects into the subfolder by dragging-and-dropping them from the 
  parent folder in the object tree to the subfolder. You can only delete empty 
  subfolders, so if you want to delete a subfolder first move all the objects in that 
  subfolder to the parent folder and then you can delete the subfolder.
</p>


<h3>Keywords for Tagging Objects</h3>

<p>
  This feature gives users the ability to apply keywords to objects and 
  then use the filter box to search for objects that match a keyword.
</p>


<h3>Dynamic Groups with Smart Filters</h3>

<p>
  A new type of group, called a Dynamic Group, has been added to the Group object
  in the object tree. Right-click the Group object and select "New Dynamic Group" 
  to create a new group. You can use both Keywords and Object Type to create 
  filters of objects that should be included in the Dynamic Group. There is a 
  preview window that displays all the objects that match the filter.
</p>

<p>
  You can use Dynamic groups in rules just like you would use a
  regular Group object. When Firewall Builder compiles a rule that
  includes a Dynamic Group it will expand the group into all its
  member objects.
</p>


<h3>Multiple Operations per Filter Rule</h3>

<p>
  The actions for <b>Tag</b>, <b>Classify</b> and <b>Route</b> have
  been moved to the rule Options. This allows a user to define a
  primary action, like Accept, and then define additional actions that
  should be taken on traffic that matches the rule.
</p>

<p>
  This is only supported for <b>iptables</b> and <b>PF</b>
  platforms. For PF setting multiple actions will result in a single
  rule with multiple actions defined. For iptables this will result in
  multiple rules ordered so that all actions are performed correctly.
</p> 


<h3>New Attached Networks Object</h3>

<p>
  There is a new child object for interfaces that represents all the
  networks that are "attached" to the interface. This means that for
  each IP address that is configured on an interface the associated
  network for that IP address will be included in the Attached
  Networks object.
</p>


<h3>Improved GUI layout and behavior</h3>

<p>
  There are a number of changes that have been made to make the mouse
  click behavior more consistent and the layout of the GUI has been
  updated to make things simplier.
</p>

<h3>Import of PF configurations</h3>

<p> 
  Firewall Builder can now import PF configurations in pf.conf format. To 
  import a pf.conf configuration go to File -> Import Firewall and follow the 
  prompts.

<a name="gui"></a>
<h2>GUI Updates</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Crash when selecting New Firewall and existing firewall has
      interface that is locked". Fixed GUI crash that happened on some
      operations if an object in the tree was locked. For example, if
      the user locked an interface of one of the firewall objects that
      then proceeded to create new firewall object, the GUI would
      crash. The problem was not limited to locking specifically
      interface objects.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      part of the GUI usability improvements, its behavior when user
      double clicks on "any" in a rule has changed. Now the program
      opens object "any" in the editor and shows prompt text that
      explains its behavior.  The editor stays read-only and should
      appear grayed-out if palette is set up for that. 
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      when user double clicks on a firewall object to open it in the
      editor, rule set view panel switches to the rule set of that
      firewall. To decide which rule set to show, the program scans
      history of the objects the user opened before in the same GUI
      session and shows that firewall's rule set they opened last. If
      user never opened any rule sets of this firewall, then the first
      Policy object is shown. 
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed several GUI crashes that happened when user performed
      various operations on the object tree that contained locked
      objects. 
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      implementation of keywords associated with objects in the GUI;
      ability to filter by keywords, dialog layout changes to add GUI
      controls for keywords.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Removed obsolete localization files (Russian and
      Japanese). These were incomplete and have never been updated for
      v4.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Removed transfer agent code. This eliminates dependency on DBus
      framework.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Added support for creating user-defined subfolders.  The
      subfolders exist purely in the display and are not reflected in
      the FWObject tree, in order to keep changes in the back-end to a
      minimum.  New attribute "subfolders" on a system folder tells
      the gui what additional child elements to display in the tree,
      and attribute "folder" on any FWObject tells gui which child
      tree element to put it in.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Added feature : directory location caching.  Use
      FWBSettings::{get|set}OpenFileDir() any time we use QFileDialog
      so that the directory you navigated to last time shows up in the
      next file dialog.  This behavior is overridden by setting a
      working directory.  If the directory no longer exists,
      gracefully fall back to something sensible.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Add context menu to move an interface to be a child of another
      interface". New context menu (submenu) allows user to move an
      interface in the tree to make it a subinterface of another
      interface.

    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Implemented support for address table alternate paths.  There's
      a "data directory" setting under user preferences.  If the user
      selects an address table file using "choose file" and that file
      is "inside" the data directory, then the appropriate part of the
      path is replaced with %DATADIR% as a variable.  If the address
      table is marked "run-time" then the path is taken from the
      firewall data directory option.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Fixed bug: save the expanded/collapsed state of the tree when
      the user starts typing something into the quick filter.  When
      the quick filter is cleared, re-expand any items that started
      off expanded (so we get the union of expanded items displayed by
      quick filter plus what the user started with expanded).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Attempting to copy-and-paste a tag service results in an
      error". Pasting of a TagService object to the "Tag Services"
      group did not work.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Enhance Find to include searching for IP addresses in
      ranges". Function "find" now finds ip addresses inside address
      ranges.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Expanded set of options the user can change to pre-set
      parameters in the new policy rules they create". Now user can
      set default values for action ("Deny" or "Accept"), direction,
      the "stateless" flag and logging.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes bug "If file doesn't exist when clicking 'edit file',
      then you have to hit save button twice".  The bug affected "edit
      file" function in the Address Table object dialog.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Remove Back and Forward buttons". We have decided behavior of
      the GUI was too complicated since user can both act on objects
      directly and navigate backwards and forwards to the objects
      found in their browsing history.  Navigation using browsing
      history was broken when quick filter was in use, too. All in
      all, it feels the value of "back" and "forward" buttons was
      relatively low.
    </p>
  </li>

<h2>Changes in policy importer for all supported platforms</h2>

<h3>Changes that affect import of PF configurations</h3>
<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      This version implements import of pf.conf configuration with the
      following limitations:
      <ul>
	<li> anchors are not imported.  Anchor rules are imported but rules
	  inside anchors are not.</li>
	<li> only pf.conf configurations designed with the use of keyword
	  "quick" can be imported.</li>
	<li> Macros are expanded during import and are not recreated as
	  objects.  Tables are imported as run-time AddressTable obejcts
	  configured with the file name, or object groups.</li>
	<li> User has to specify host OS and PF version number during import
	  process because interpretation of rules with default settings
	  of some parameters is version-dependent.</li>
	<li> Import of IPv6 addresses and ICMPv6 matches in pf.conf is not
	  supported at this time.</li>
	<li> Import of TCP flag matches for flags 'E' and 'W' is not supported.</li>
	<li> Import of "include" clause is not supported</li>
	<li> Import of "user" and "group" matches is not supported</li>
	<li> as of v4.2 we can not generate optional parameters for
	  the "source-hash" pooltype. "sticky-address" is not
	  supported either. This options are not imported.</li>
	<li> Interface group names are not recognized</li>
	<li> commands "set ruleset-optimization", "set loginterface",
	  "set block-policy", "set state-defaults", "set require-order",
	  "set fingerprints", "set reassemble", "set hostid" are not supported.</li>

      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixes and improvements in import of iptables configurations</h3>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      Implemented import of iptables rules with target CLASSIFY.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>

<a name="libfwbuilder"></a>
<h2>Changes and improvements in the API library libfwbuilder</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      <b>New object type "Attached Networks"</b>: network object that
      automatically matches subnets an interface is attached to. The
      object can be a child of an interface. The object is optional
      and is not created automatically for all interfaces; user can
      add it using context menu associated with an interface. Dialog
      for this object allows editing of the name and comment. List of
      network addresses represented by this object is always generated
      automatically. Compiler for PF translates this object to
      "en0:network" construct that is supported by PF. Compiler for
      iptables expands it to the list of ipv4 and ipv6 networks
      defined by the addresses of the parent interface if interface
      has static addresses. If interface is confgiured as "dynamic"
      and has no address in fwbuilder, then compiler treats
      AttachedNetworks object as run-time and uses shell function to
      determine network addresses during activation of the firewall
      script. Compilers for other firewall platforms always treat this
      object as compile-time and abort if it is used with dynamic
      interface.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <b>New object type "Dynamic Group"</b>. Dynamic group
      automatically expands to a set of objects using matching rules
      that at this time can match object types and keywords.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Updated error message that appears when user tries to open .fwb
      file created by the future version of fwbuilder.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>





<!-- ######################################################################### -->
<a name="compilers"></a>
<h2>common changes that affect policy compilers for all platforms</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed bug "Compile fails if firewall has locked interface that
      is set to dynamic".
    </p>
  </li>


</ul>


<!-- ######################################################################### -->
<a name="iptables"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for iptables</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      'Mixing Actions "Accept" and "Classify" results in incorrect
      rules', and 'Mixing Actions "Accept" and "Tag" results in
      incorrect ruleset'.  After we made Tag, Classify and Route rule
      options instead of actions, rules that mix these options with
      actions "Accept" and others, except for "Continue", should be
      treated differently. The action are now implemented using
      iptables rules in the table "filter" and additional rules in
      table "mangle" is used to implement only tagging, classification
      or routing. Generated script does not change default action in
      table "mangle" and assumes it is "ACCEPT" so adding rules with
      target ACCEPT in mangle table should not be necessary. Another
      change because of this affects branching rules that use option
      "create branch in mangle table in addition to the filter
      table". These rules used to duplicate the same action and
      logging rules in mangle.  Now they dont do this and only create
      rules in mangle if branch rule set performs tagging,
      classification or routing.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Deprecating Route option for iptables".  This target is not
      included in any of the popular Linux distributions (checked in
      Ubuntu, Fedora and CentOS). The GUI dialog and all support in
      the compiler will be removed in future version of
      fwbuilder. Beginning with 4.3.0, compiler aborts with an error
      when it encounters a rule using this option. In older versions
      of fwbuilder (4.2.x and before) this option was presented as an
      action "Route".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Tag action should be done in PREROUTING so it can be acted on
      later". If a rule has both tagging and classification options,
      the rule should be split so that iptables command doing tagging
      goes in PREROUTING and rule doing classification goes into
      POSTROUTING chain.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Tag and classify actions dont work properly with branches".
      When branching rule points to a rule set that has rules with Tag
      and Classify options, branching should occur in mangle table
      even when checkbox "create branch in mangle table" is not
      checked. The fix in this change is tentative as it creates
      branch in chains PREROUTING, POSTROUTING and OUTPUT. Since
      target CLASSIFY is only allowed in POSTROUTING, this may create
      conflict. Need to test more.

    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Added support for single object negation in "Inbound Interface"
      and "Outbound Interface" columns in compiler for iptables.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug 3371301 "Error compiling with VLAN and
      masquerade". Iptables NAT rules with vlan interface configured
      as "dynamic" and no ip address in Translated Source caused
      compiler crash.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>



<!-- ######################################################################### -->
<a name="pf"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for PF (FreeBSD, OpenBSD)</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      "PF compiler should use 'self' keyword where
      appropriate". Compiler for PF now uses keyword 'self' in rules
      where firewall object is used in Source or Destination.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Added support for single object negation in "Interface" rule
      element of PF NAT rules. Now compiler can produce PF commands
      such as "nat on ! em0 ... " (for PF <4.7) or "match on ! em0
      ..." (for PF >= 4.7)
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      NAT Compiler for PF should use "(interface)" syntax to the right
      of "-&gt;" in NAT rules.  This now works for all interfaces,
      including those that have ip addresses in fwbuilder
      configuration, when interface object appears in "Translated
      Source" in a nat rule. When firewall object appears in
      "Translated Source", it gets replaced with a set of its
      interfaces which also get translated into "-&gt; (interface)".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed bug "PF compiler crashes when ipv4+ipv6 NAT rule uses only
      ipv4 address". This has been reported as SF bug 3305234.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      'avoid " {tcp udp icmp} " in place of protocol'. NAT compiler
      for PF does not need to generate protocol match "proto {tcp udp
      icmp}" when service object used in the NAT rule is "any". The
      reason this was done this way is lost in the mist of time; it's
      been like this since very early versions of fwbuilder.
    </p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p>
      "Update generated route-to configuration for PF versions 4.7 and
      later", SF bug 3348931. The "route-to" parameter moved to the
      end of pass rules in PF 4.7
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Crash when compiling a route with table object". Compiler for
      PF crashed when run-time AddressTable object was used in RDst of
      a routing rule.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      "Group and Address Table name persistence in generated
      config". Compiler for PF can now preserve names of object
      groups, dynamic groups, compile-time AddressTable and
      compile-time DNSName objects in the generated pf.conf file. This
      is optional and is controlled by a checkbox in the firewall
      settings dialog.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes bug "Run-time dns name or address table in routing
      policy -&gt; crash". Compiler for PF crashed if user placed
      run-time DNSName object in "destination" of a routing rule.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixes bug "PF: NAT compiler fails when run-time address table
      object is used in a rule"
    </p>
  </li>


</ul>
