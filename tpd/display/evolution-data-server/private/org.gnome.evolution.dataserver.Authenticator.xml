    Interface for an authentication session.

<interface name="org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Authenticator">
  <!--
      Ready:
      @encryption_key: Implementation defined encryption key

      Indicates the client is ready to receive Response signals.
      If this method is not called within a short duration after
      the object path for this interface is exported, the object
      path will be unexported.

  <!--
      Cancel:

      Indicates the client no longer wishes to authenticate.
      Any active or pending authentication prompt will be cancelled,
      and the object path for this interface will be unexported.

      The object path for this interface will be unexported.

      This method ends the authentication session.
  -->
  <method name="Cancel"/>

  <!--
      Accepted:

      Indicates the most-recently-passed secret was accepted.  If the
      user wishes, the secret can be copied to a keyring for permanent
      storage at this point.

      The object path for this interface will be unexported.

      This method ends the authentication session.
  -->
  <method name="Accepted"/>

  <!--
      Rejected:

      Indicates the most-recently-passed secret was rejected.  The
      client should continue listening for a new Authenticate signal.
  -->
  <method name="Rejected"/>

  <!--
      Authenticate:
      @encrypted_secret: Encrypted secret string

      Emitted when the user has responded to an authentication prompt.

      The client should attempt to authenticate using the provided
      secret and then respond by calling either Accepted, Rejected
      or Cancel.  The Authenticate signal will not be emitted again
      until the client has responded.

      If at any time the user cancels the authentication prompt, the
      Dismissed signal is emitted immediately.
  -->
  <signal name="Authenticate">
    <arg name="encrypted_secret" type="s"/>
  </signal>

  <!--
      Dismissed:

      Emitted when the user has declined to provide a secret.

      Any further attempts to authenticate the Source will emit a
      Dismissed signal without interrupting the user.  This state
      persists until the ResetAuthDismissal method is called.

      This signal ends the authentication session.
  -->
  <signal name="Dismissed"/>
