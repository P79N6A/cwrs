Lxconfd is a gconfd like replacment with fallback support.
If lxconfd is not running or not eaven installed apps can still work,
they will use GKeyFile insted.

Another feature (not yet implemented) are channels and messages.
Example:
  lxsound /* a sound daemon for lxde */
  When an app whants to play a sount it sends a message "sound.ogg" to channel PLAY.
  If there is no lxsound active or no PLAY channel no problem no sound will be played
  and the app still works.

  lxspeak /* text to speach daemon */
  To make you pc speak app would just need to send a message "this is a test text" to channel SPEAK (or SAY)
